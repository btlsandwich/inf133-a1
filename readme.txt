--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

Because this was based on an existing portfolio, it only took me a few hours to adapt. I spent most of the time making the portfolio responsive for resizing on different screens, and I spent some time revising the CSS style of the site.

4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)

Bootstrap documentation (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/, https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/, https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/tables/, ), fontawesome.com for icons, INF133 slides. Images were hosted on Glitch, which was the previous site host.

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

No classmates. Previous framework on this portfolio was done in 2020 and I consulted my Senior Fellow at the time, Malcolm, for help on the navigation bar and Bootstrap setup.

6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
